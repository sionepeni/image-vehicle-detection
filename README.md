# Image Vehicle Detection

I was given a task to build an application to find similar vehicles & recognise
vehicles by either Model or body-type using a cloud based service.

I chose to go with Google's Vision AutoML service.

To get this app working, you'll need to train a new AutoML model and import the the details in server.js lines 9 - 16.
You will also need a filestack account and update the details in App.js line 85.
Finally an npm install in both directories and you should be ready to go.

This is a task from my Advanced Software Development (ASD) Course
